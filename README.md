# Breathe
Breathe is an app inspired from the Apple Watch Breathe app. 
The act of paying attention to your breathing - taking deep breaths in a slow and measured fashion - can be extremely beneficial.
And even if you don't see any physical health benefits, it's a good way to take a break from the stress of the day.
With Apple Breathe you set a breathing session usually one minute. 
The app then coaches you through the session, as you practise breathing with the help of an animation. 
The app also shows the last time a session was completed and the number of minutes the the total session was used in a day.
